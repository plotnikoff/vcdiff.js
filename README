Implementation of VCDiff (RFC 3284) in Javascript. Can be run on client or 
server. Current implementation was ported to javascript from 
http://code.google.com/p/diffable/ project.
According to RFC 3284: "The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression 
Data Format." Javascript implementation uses regular Array for deltas.

Usage.
Say we have two strings:
	"abcdef"
	"defghiabc"
and we want to calculate diff between them. Code will be as follows:

    var vcd = new diffable.Vcdiff(), delta;
    vcd.blockSize = 3; //setting blockSize to 3 (defaults to 20)
    delta = vcd.encode('abcdef', 'defghiabc');
    console.log(delta); // [3, 3, 'ghi', 0, 3]

//if we want to decode data from original string and delta:

    console.log(vcd.decode('abcdef', delta)); //'defghiabc'
